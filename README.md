# Battleship
Battleship game created in Pygame Zero

Based on the Battleship game featured in Beginning Game Programming with Pygame Zero:

[Book Beginning Game Programming with Pygame Zero - Apress / Springer](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-5650-3) 

This is simple battleship game, where you have to outsmart the computer by sinking all their fleet first.

This has now been developed further. It supports two different screen sizes. To enable small screen size (used for pip) then update battleship.py with 
```SIZE_SML = True```

For a large screen size update battleship.py with
```SIZE_SML = True```

To run 
```python3 battleship.py ```
